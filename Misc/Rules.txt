Rules:

// Result text format: Json dictionary style string, e.g. "{"path" : #path#, ... }"

// Actual rules (formalize later)
start: #section# #path# #background# #music#
music**: TBD (something ambient?)
section: #section_length# #angles# #cam_speed (always relative to length)#
path: #path_color# #path_glow# #path_terrain# ##
background: #[color:#ground_color#][terrain:#ground_terrain#][glow:#ground_glow#]ground# #sky# #items#
ground: 
sky: #sky_color# #sky_gradient# #sky_glow# #sky_terrain (should include clouds sometimes!)# #weather_effects#
sky_gradient: no_gradient, gradient second color: #second_sky_color (second color to gradient to)#
weather_effects**: #weather_intensity# #weather_type# #weather_color#
weather_type**: hail, rain, dust?, TBD

TODO:
* Color of some item should be determined along with other items' colors - they affect each other (same for glow)
* Should there be some general ground terrain and sky terrain? Same for anything else that could be generalized
* Angles - generate options during runtime: limit according to previous section
* Anything marked with "**" is for version 2, or after POC (a.k.a extras). Do NOT worry about these now, 
  but try and keep things modular for easy future integration.
